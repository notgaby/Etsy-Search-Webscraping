# Etsy-Search-Webscraping
**This project was created during my independent study class as a senior in high school. **

This project would webscrape data from searching 'Back to School Sign' on Etsy. Some of the data it acquired include the name of the shop, the title, the listing image, and the price. After gathering the information, it would create a csv file with all the data and a pictures folder to save all the pictures gathered. Tkinter would then be used to create a simple GUI to put all the images together on the screen allowing the user to click the image and be directed to the product listing on Etsy. All of the output files can be found in the "output" folder.

This project introduced me to data visualization, simple GUI's, webscraping, and Requests.
